Configuration Yeoman generated projects can be further tweaked according to your needs by modifying project files appropriately. A .yo-rc file is generated for helping you copy configuration across projects, and to allow you to keep track of your settings. You can change this as you see fit. Testing Running gulp test will run the client and server unit tests with karma and mocha. Use gulp test:server to only run server tests. Use gulp test:client to only run client tests. Protractor tests To setup protractor e2e tests, you must first run npm run update-webdriver Use gulp test:e2e to have protractor go through tests located in the e2e folder. Code Coverage Use gulp test:coverage to run mocha-istanbul and generate code coverage reports. coverage\/server will be populated with e2e and unit folders containing the lcov reports. The coverage taget has 3 available options: test:coverage:unit generate server unit test coverage test:coverage:e2e generate server e2e test coverage test:coverage:check combine the coverage reports and check against predefined thresholds when no option is given test:coverage runs all options in the above order Debugging Use gulp serve:debug for a more debugging-friendly environment. Environment Variables Keeping your app secrets and other sensitive information in source control isn't a good idea. To have gulp launch your app with specific environment variables, add them to the git ignored environment config file: server\/config\/local.env.js.

You'll need it for things like brotli compression. Read through the Installation section of the node-gyp readme. Basically you'll need Python 2.7, make, and a C\/C++ compiler (like GCC on unix, Xcode on OS X, or Visual Studio tools on Windows). To tell npm to use Python 2.7 (if you also have a different version installed), run npm config set python \/path\/to\/executable\/python2.7. Here's a snapshot of the instructions from their readme: On Unix: python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported) make A proper C\/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC On Mac OS X: python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported) (already installed on Mac OS X) Xcode You also need to install the Command Line Tools via Xcode. You can find this under the menu Xcode -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Downloads This step will install gcc and the related toolchain containing make On Windows: Option 1: Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's windows-build-tools using npm install --global --production windows-build-tools from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe (run as Administrator). Option 2: Install tools and configuration manually: Visual C++ Build Environment: Option 1: Install Visual C++ Build Tools using the Default Install option. Option 2: Install Visual Studio 2015 (or modify an existing installation) and select Common Tools for Visual C++ during setup. This also works with the free Community and Express for Desktop editions. :bulb: [Windows Vista \/ 7 only] requires .NET Framework 4.5.1 Install Python 2.7 (v3.x.x is not supported), and run npm config set python python2.7 (or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper Python version and path.) Launch cmd, npm config set msvs_version 2015 If the above steps didn't work for you, please visit Microsoft's Node.js Guidelines for Windows for additional tips.

This will do some preliminary things like clean out temporary files, lint your scripts, inject any new CSS files into your main one, apply environment variables, and download any new TypeScript definitions. It will then start up a new development server, which will kick off a Webpack build. it uses Browser Sync to facilitate front-end development. Your files will also be watched for changes. Any front-end changes will kick off another webpack build. Any back-end changes will restart the back-end server, cleaning the development database and re-seeding it as well.

And then our default browser should open up to the app: Fantastic! We're now up and running with our Full-Stack Angular web application! So what can it do? Homepage Assuming you scaffolded with a back-end database, you should see some 'features'. If you scaffolded with socket.io, you should see 'x' buttons next to each, and an input box. Try opening two browser windows to the same page side-by-side, and hitting the 'x' on one of the features. You should see the feature get removed on both web pages. Neat! This is because these database object changes are communicated to clients using socket.io. Neat. Let's see what else we can do. Auth Assuming you scaffolded with auth support, you should see a 'Sign Up' and a 'Log In' button at the top-right of your page. Let's go to the Log In page. You should see inputs for an email address and a password. When running your project in a devlopment environment, you'll get two user accounts automatically generated: Test User email: test@example.com password: test role: user Admin email: admin@example.com password: admin role: admin Go ahead and log in with the admin account, so we can see the extra admin bits too. You should then get sent back to the home page, but should notice that the navbar looks a bit different: First, at the top right, we see a greeting for our username, a cog icon (for user settings), and a logout button. Then, since we're an admin, we see a new 'Admin' state on the navbar. The admin section lists users and allows you to delete them. The user settings page allows you to change your password.","tags":"","url":"Developing\/Starting_Up.html"},{"title":"Adding a Route","text":"Adding a Route Alright, now let's add another route to our app. We'll call it 'foo'. We can easily do this with the yo angular-fullstack:route subgenerator command: $ yo angular-fullstack:route foo ? What module name would you like to use? (aftestApp.foo) ? What module name would you like to use? aftestApp.foo ? Where would you like to create this route? (client\/app\/) ? Where would you like to create this route? client\/app\/ ? What will the url of your route be? (\/foo) ? What will the url of your route be? \/foo identical client\\app\\foo\\foo.routes.js identical client\\app\\foo\\foo.component.js identical client\\app\\foo\\foo.component.spec.js identical client\\app\\foo\\foo.html identical client\\app\\foo\\foo.scss In the parent of this component, you should now import this component and add it as a dependency: import FooComponent from '.\/foo\/foo.component'; ... export angular.module('myParentModule', [FooComponent]); We give it our route name ('foo'), and a few more details: the name of the Angular module to create ('myApp.foo'), which folder to put the route under ('client\/app\/foo\/'), and the URL of the route ('localhost:3000\/foo'). This will create an Angular 1.5 component with an Angular module (foo.component.js), a template file (foo.html), a CSS file (foo.scss), a unit test file (foo.component.spec.js), and a routing file (foo.routes.js). Since we're using Webpack, We'll need to import our component somewhere. Since this is a generic app route (and for simplicity), we'll import it in app.js, under our root Angular module, like so: client\/app\/app.js ... import FooModule from '.\/foo\/foo.component'; angular.module('aftestApp', [ ... main, FooModule, ]) .config(routeConfig) .run(...); angular.element(document) .ready(() =&gt; { angular.bootstrap(document, ['aftestApp'], { strictDi: true }); }); Now that we've imported our new Angular module and added it to the dependency list of our root Angular module, we should be able to navigate to http:\/\/localhost:3000\/foo and see our new route: It's not a very impressive page right now, but it works. Now, our user's aren't going to know to go to the \/foo route. Let's add a navbar entry for it. client\/components\/navbar\/navbar.component.js import angular from 'angular'; export class NavbarComponent { menu = [{ title: 'Home', state: 'main' }, { title: 'Foo', state: 'foo' }]; isCollapsed = true; constructor(Auth) { 'ngInject'; this.isLoggedIn = Auth.isLoggedInSync; this.isAdmin = Auth.isAdminSync; this.getCurrentUser = Auth.getCurrentUserSync; } } export default angular.module('directives.navbar', []) .component('navbar', { template: require('.\/navbar.html'), controller: NavbarComponent }) .name; Easy enough. Now we should see our entry for 'Foo' in our navbar. It should also be highlighted if you're still on the '\/foo' route.
